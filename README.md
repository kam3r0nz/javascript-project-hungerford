# Notify

Notify is an application that allows a user to manage their music collection. A user can add songs and delete them if they no longer want that song in their collection. Notify uses JavaScript as it's frontend and a Rails API for it's backend. 

# Installation

And then execute:

# Usage

After cloning the repository and running bundle, the server can be started from the backend:
Step 1) Run: rake db:migrate
Step 2) Run: rake db:seed
Step 3) Run: rails s

Index.html, on the frontend, should then be opened in a browser.
