# Notify

Notify is an application that allows a user to manage their music collection. A user can add songs and delete them if they no longer want that song in their collection. Notify uses JavaScript as it's frontend and a Rails API for it's backend. 

# Installation

To use this app, just clone this [repo](https://github.com/kam3r0nz/javascript-project-hungerford).

And then execute:

$ `bundle install`

# Usage

After cloning the repository and running bundle, the server can be started from the backend: <br>
Step 1) Run: `rake db:migrate` <br>
Step 2) Run: `rake db:seed` <br>
Step 3) Run: `rails s` <br>

Index.html, on the frontend, should then be opened in a browser.
